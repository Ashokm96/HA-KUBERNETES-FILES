#You have to follow the procedure step by step and in the same order to have 3 master HA kubernetes cluster on CENTOS 7 machines.

1) You need 7 , Centos 7 machines according for below purposes
   - API SERVER LOAD BALANCER   
   - MASTER1
   - MASTER2
   - MASTER3
   - WORKER-NODE1
   - WORKER-NODE2
   - USER-REQUEST-LOAD-BALANCER

2) Make sure you use new or completely clean CENTOS 7 machines with no packages pre-installed on them 

3) All steps has to be run as root user
   STEPS - 
         i)   Create the API server load balancer with the script provided on first machine
   
        ii)   Create MASTER1 with the master1-initialization script 
 
       iii)   Wait for script to end completely , it takes 15 mins approx
         
        iv)   Keep a close eye on green lines coming while script is executing
         
         v)   Do not forget to copy and save on notepad , JOINING TOKENS , DASHBOARD ACCESS TOKEN from the script execution output
         
        vi)   Fire script for MASTER2 and MASTER3 on their respective machines
         
       vii)   Once the MASTER2 & MASTER3 scripts are complete , Immediately fire CONTROL PLANE JOINING TOKENS received from MASTER1 script output
        
      viii)   Completely Read the MASTER1 Script output on MASTER1 machine , follow guidelines in Green text and login to dashboard using access token
         
        ix)   Firing "kubectl get nodes -o wide" every MASTER NODE , should show you all MASTERS in READY state.
         
         x)   Now , RUN worker-node initialization on both the worker nodes 
         
        xi)   Once the worker node script execution is complete , Immediate fire WORKER NODE JOINING TOKEN received from MASTER1 script execution output
        
       xii)   Wait for 5 mins and go to ANY MASTER NODE and fire "kubectl get nodes -o wide" , Every node should see READY state
      
      xiii)   If every node is in READY state your HA-MULTIMASTER-KUBERNETES-CLUSTER is ready to use.
        
       xiv)   Now you can run USER-REQUEST-LOAD-BALANCER script on a dedicated new machine to load balance traffic coming on your application
              across all worker nodes , You can create USER-REQUEST-LOAD-BALANCER after doing deployments in a cluster


IMPORTANT: EVERY SCRIPT IS FOR DEDICATED NODE , DO NOT USE MASTER1 SCRIPT ON ANY OTHER MASTER OR NODE OR LOADBALANCER.
           IT IS GOOD TO HAVE DOMAIN NAMES AND HOSTNAMES MAPPED ON EACH OF MACHINES AND THEY SHOULD BE RESOLVABLE FROM EVERY MACHINES IN IMPLEMENTATION
